# ZapperFromGit

How I tested the applications
I have tested the device on a onePlus3 device.

#I  have checked if the the applications keeps the same instance when its rotated.
#Checked what happens when there is no connection to the internet
#Checked what happens if its put in the background and one reopens it again
#Checked if it getsall the data from the api
#Checked if all the data is displayed
#Checked what happens if you turn off the data while its still getting the api

All this test cases pass
